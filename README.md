# White-House-Salaries

Basic data analysis using python (White House dataset)

## Context:
For democracy to function, we need transparency. Part of the transparency is given to us through government salaries and names of employees. Since 1996, the White House has been required by Congress to disclose a list of staff and their salaries.

## Acknowledgements:

I would like to thank @julilangston and @carblewis at data.world for providing these datasets.

## Inspiration:

Was given as a part of my mini project for pandas module
How much did each administration spend on Immigration advisor/assistant staff?
Who has more executive assistants?
